# lungs_disease_prediction
Lung cancer is one of the leading causes of death worldwide. Early prediction based on risk factors like age, smoking, anxiety, chronic disease, and fatigue can drastically improve prognosis. This project applies machine learning to predict lung cancer risks based on patient medical data.
 Lung Cancer Prediction Project that you can use for research, academic, or deployment purposes (e.g., on GitHub). It uses machine learning to predict the likelihood of lung cancer based on patient data. Below is a complete structure including:
